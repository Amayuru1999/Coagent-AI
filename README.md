<p align="center">
<img src="assets/coagent-three-tier-architecture.png" height="500">
</p>


## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/OpenCSGs/coagent.git
```


## Quick Start


### Monolithic

Implement the agent:

```python
# translator.py

import asyncio
import os

from coagent.agents import ChatAgent, ChatMessage, ModelClient
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, new, set_stderr_logger
from coagent.runtimes import LocalRuntime

translator = AgentSpec(
    "translator",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="You are a professional translator that can translate Chinese to English.",
        client=ModelClient(model="openai/gpt-4o", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    ),
)


async def main():
    async with LocalRuntime() as runtime:
        await runtime.register(translator)

        result = await translator.run(
            ChatMessage(role="user", content="你好，世界").encode(),
            stream=True,
        )
        async for chunk in result:
            msg = ChatMessage.decode(chunk)
            print(msg.content, end="", flush=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_stderr_logger()
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the agent:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
python translator.py
```


### Distributed

Start a NATS server ([docs][3]):

```bash
docker run -p 4222:4222 --name nats-server -ti nats:latest
```

Implement the agent:

```python
# translator.py

import asyncio
import os

from coagent.agents import ChatAgent, ModelClient
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, idle_loop, new, set_stderr_logger
from coagent.runtimes import NATSRuntime

translator = AgentSpec(
    "translator",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="You are a professional translator that can translate Chinese to English.",
        client=ModelClient(model="openai/gpt-4o", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    ),
)


async def main():
    async with NATSRuntime.from_servers("nats://localhost:4222") as runtime:
        await runtime.register(translator)
        await idle_loop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_stderr_logger()
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the agent as a daemon:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
python translator.py
```

Communicate with the agent:

```bash
coagent translator -H type:ChatMessage --chat -d '{"role": "user", "content": "你好，世界"}'
```


## Patterns

(The following patterns are mainly inspired by [Anthropic's Building effective agents][4] and [OpenAI's Orchestrating Agents][5].)

### Basic: Augmented LLM

**Augmented LLM** is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/patterns-augmented-llm.png">
</p>

**Example** (see [examples/patterns/augmented_llm.py](examples/patterns/augmented_llm.py) for a runnable example):

```python
from coagent.agents import ChatAgent, ModelClient, tool
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, new


class Assistant(ChatAgent):
    system = """You are an agent who can use tools."""
    client = ModelClient(...)

    @tool
    async def query_weather(self, city: str) -> str:
        """Query the weather in the given city."""
        return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."


assistant = AgentSpec("assistant", new(Assistant))
```

### Workflow: Chaining

**Chaining** decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each agent processes the output of the previous one.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/patterns-chaining.png">
</p>

**When to use this workflow:** This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each agent an easier task.

**Example** (see [examples/patterns/chaining.py](examples/patterns/chaining.py) for a runnable example):

```python
from coagent.agents import ChatAgent, Sequential, ModelClient
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, new

client = ModelClient(...)

extractor = AgentSpec(
    "extractor",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Extract only the numerical values and their associated metrics from the text.
Format each as 'value: metric' on a new line.
Example format:
92: customer satisfaction
45%: revenue growth\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

converter = AgentSpec(
    "converter",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Convert all numerical values to percentages where possible.
If not a percentage or points, convert to decimal (e.g., 92 points -> 92%).
Keep one number per line.
Example format:
92%: customer satisfaction
45%: revenue growth\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

sorter = AgentSpec(
    "sorter",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Sort all lines in descending order by numerical value.
Keep the format 'value: metric' on each line.
Example:
92%: customer satisfaction
87%: employee satisfaction\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

formatter = AgentSpec(
    "formatter",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Format the sorted data as a markdown table with columns:
| Metric | Value |
|:--|--:|
| Customer Satisfaction | 92% |\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

chain = AgentSpec(
    "chain", new(Sequential, "extractor", "converter", "sorter", "formatter")
)
```

### Workflow: Parallelization

**Parallelization** distributes independent subtasks across multiple agents for concurrent processing.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/patterns-parallelization.png">
</p>

**When to use this workflow:** Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results.

**Example** (see [examples/patterns/parallelization.py](examples/patterns/parallelization.py) for a runnable example):

```python
from coagent.agents import Aggregator, ChatAgent, ModelClient, Parallel
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, new

client = ModelClient(...)

customer = AgentSpec(
    "customer",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Customers:
- Price sensitive
- Want better tech
- Environmental concerns\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

employee = AgentSpec(
    "employee",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Employees:
- Job security worries
- Need new skills
- Want clear direction\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

investor = AgentSpec(
    "investor",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Investors:
- Expect growth
- Want cost control
- Risk concerns\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

supplier = AgentSpec(
    "supplier",
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
Suppliers:
- Capacity constraints
- Price pressures
- Tech transitions\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

aggregator = AgentSpec("aggregator", new(Aggregator))

parallel = AgentSpec(
    "parallel",
    new(
        Parallel,
        "customer",
        "employee",
        "investor",
        "supplier",
        aggregator="aggregator",
    ),
)
```


### Workflow: Triaging & Routing

**Triaging** classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup agent. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized agents.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/patterns-triaging.png">
</p>

**When to use this workflow:** This workflow works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM (using Prompting or Function-calling) or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.

**Example** (see [examples/patterns/triaging.py](examples/patterns/triaging.py) for a runnable example):

```python
from coagent.agents import ChatAgent, DynamicTriage, ModelClient
from coagent.core import AgentSpec, new

client = ModelClient(...)

billing = AgentSpec(
    "team.billing",  # Under the team namespace
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
You are a billing support specialist. Follow these guidelines:
1. Always start with "Billing Support Response:"
2. First acknowledge the specific billing issue
3. Explain any charges or discrepancies clearly
4. List concrete next steps with timeline
5. End with payment options if relevant

Keep responses professional but friendly.\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

account = AgentSpec(
    "team.account",  # Under the team namespace
    new(
        ChatAgent,
        system="""\
You are an account security specialist. Follow these guidelines:
1. Always start with "Account Support Response:"
2. Prioritize account security and verification
3. Provide clear steps for account recovery/changes
4. Include security tips and warnings
5. Set clear expectations for resolution time

Maintain a serious, security-focused tone.\
""",
        client=client,
    ),
)

triage = AgentSpec(
    "triage",
    new(
        DynamicTriage,
        system="""You are a triage agent who will delegate to sub-agents based on the conversation content.""",
        client=client,
        namespace="team",  # Collect all sub-agents under the team namespace
    ),
)
```
